## The Problem

Students in my INFS-375 Database Programming class currently have access to a LAMP stack administered by the IT Dept.

I wanted full control over the stack and to give myself and other students the ability to see behind the curtain, mess up, tear the server down, and to easily get running again.

For those students who don't want to dig deep, this provides a localized, working LAMP stack just the same.

## Solution -- In Development

An automated way to create/tear-down/customize a LAMP using

1. https://www.packer.io/
2. https://www.vagrantup.com/
3. https://www.chef.io/

## Goals

1. Get buy-in to install these tools on the classroom computers
2. Give my code to the professor to use in future classes
